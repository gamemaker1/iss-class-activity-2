# - The function definition lacked a colon at the end, a syntax error.
# - The function parameter `target` was mispelled as `targ` while computing `max_num`.
# - There was an unneccessary semicolon after defining the `solutions` variable.
def find_cube_pairs(target):

    # - The for loop initialization lacked colons at the end, both syntax errors.
    # - The function used to return a range of numbers was mispelled as `ranges` instead of `range`.
    # - The `if` statement lacked a colon at the end.
    # - The `target` variable was mispelled as `targ`. The `solution` variable was also mispelled as `sol`.
    # - The `pow` operator was written as `***` (three stars) instead of `**` (two stars).
    # - There was an unneccessary semicolon after the `solutions.append(...)` statement too.

# - The first two lines had a `,` at the end, thus preventing the for loop from being interpreted correctly.
# - The for loop initialization also lacked a colon at the end of the line.
# - The `pow` operator was again mistyped as `***` instead of `**`.
# - For formatting's sake, I also moved the form docstring to the bottom and outside the for loop.
